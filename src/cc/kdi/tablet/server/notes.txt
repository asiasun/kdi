# Notes on a new distributed serving arch for tablet servers
#----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Following the BigTable model, we'll have three classes of servers
exposing the following interfaces:

  1) LockServer
     a) Lock service interface
  2) TabletMaster
     a) Table meta interface
  3) TabletServer
     a) Table interface
     b) Master admin interface
     c) Tablet migration interface

In addition, we will have two client libraries:

  1) Lock service client for interface 1a.
  2) Table API client wraps interfaces 2a and 3a.

The LockServer and lock service client are an assumed external
service.  An application programmer only needs to work with the Table
API client.

Internally, the Table API client talks to TabletServers through the
Table interface (3a).  It will also need some minor interactions with
the LockServer through the lock service client and the TabletMaster
through the Table meta interface (2a).

The TabletServer uses the Lock service client to talk to the
LockServer.  It only needs to check and hold a lock on a single file.
It may contact another TabletServer through the Tablet migration
interface (3c) if prompted to do so by the TabletMaster.

The TabletMaster makes more extensive use of the Lock service client.
It holds a master lock and checks for server files to find
TabletServers.  It will also contact the TabletServers through the
Master admin interface (3b) in response to Table meta requests from
clients, to perform maintenance tasks, or for periodic status checks.
