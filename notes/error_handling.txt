# Error handling strategy
#----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Operations on Tables may fail immediately by throwing an exception, or
fail much later somewhere in the system.  For performance reasons, we
don't want to wait for each mutation to propagate all the way through
the system before returning from the Table call.  Instead, we'll add a
sync() method that will block until all mutations submitted so far
propagate through the system.

Table:
   sync():
      waitForMutations();
      if(errors)
          throw errors;

Additionally, we'll add a special TableError type to contain the error
information.  It is not the only exception that may be thrown, but
when it is, it may contain enough information to allow for recovery,
or at least an informative error report.  For example, if some cells
mutations failed, the error may contain the specific cells that failed
and why.

This strategy allows applications to make their own
performance/consistency trade-offs.  It is not entirely clear how the
implementation of this strategy will play out yet.
